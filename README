This is png++ the C++ wrapper for libpng.  Version 0.2.0          -*- text -*-

The png++ aims to provide simple yet powerful C++ interface to the
nice libpng, the PNG reference implementation library.

Png++ is free software distributed under a modified variant of BSD
license.  For more details please refer to file COPYING in this
directory.

Using raw libpng in C++ may impose serious challenge since lots of
precautions must be taken to handle initialization/deinitialization of
control structures as well as handling errors correctly.  With png++
you can read or write PNG images just in a single line of C++ code:

png::image< png::rgb_pixel > my_image("myimage.png");
my_image.write("myimage2.png");

In this example png++ does all the transformations needed to create
adequate in-memory RGB representation of the image (well, in most
cases it simply instructs libpng to do so).  Thus, myimage.png can be
RGB image, or it might be grayscale or even indexed image with a
palette.


Happy hacking!
